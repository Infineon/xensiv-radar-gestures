# XENSIV™ Radar Gestures

## Overview

The XENSIV™ Radar Gestures library is designed to detect human hand gestures using XENSIV™ FMCW radar sensor.
The library utilizes neural networks & advanced DSP techniques to recognize currently following hand gestures,
* PUSH
* SWIPE_UP
* SWIPE_DOWN
* SWIPE_LEFT
* SWIPE_RIGHT

The detection range of the hand gestures is supported from 0.2 m through 1.0 meters in line of sight from the radar sensor. 

   


## Features

* Gesture recognition through three simple APIs
* Delivered as statically linkable library for GCC_ARM, ARM and IAR toolchains
* Support for both **softfp** (software emulated floating point) & **hardfp** (hardware dedicated floating point) variants 
* Low latency detection: detection time of less than 1 second
* Detailed results with confidence value on each detected class of gestures
